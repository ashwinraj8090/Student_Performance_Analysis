# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis System

## 📌 Overview
The **Student Performance Analysis System** is a full-stack web application designed to analyze and predict student academic performance using machine learning techniques. The system uses a **Random Forest classifier** to predict student grades based on academic performance indicators, helping educators identify students who may require additional academic support.

The project integrates a **Python-based backend** for data processing, model training, and prediction with a **React-based frontend** for interactive visualization and result display.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Academic performance data is submitted through the frontend.
2. The backend preprocesses the data.
3. A **Random Forest machine learning model** is trained on historical data and used to predict student performance.
4. Results are returned to the frontend.
5. The frontend displays predictions and insights visually.
